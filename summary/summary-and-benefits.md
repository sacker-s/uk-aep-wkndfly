# Summary & Benefits

## Summary

In this module, you’ve learned how the Real-time Customer Profile’s identity graph is built and also, how to consume the Real-time Customer Profile on a single customer level and through the use of segments.&#x20;

You’ve also learned how to configure a segment and activate it for streaming qualification and how to take action and send that segment to Facebook.

## Benefits

Let’s highlight the benefits of the Real-time Customer Profile and Destinations:

* The Real-time Customer Profile is built on a flexible and real-time identity graph which makes it possible to dynamically merge profile fragments across multiple datasets together based on the identifiers.
* Once profile fragments are merged through the Identity Graph, any of the available identifiers can be used to retrieve a customer’s profile
* Segmentation is now done using XDM as the language behind the segment which makes the segment easily reusable and understandable
* Segments can be sent to a number of out-of-the-box destinations that are available as part of the Real-time CDP application service. These destinations include DSPs like Google DV360, The Trade Desk, ESPs like Adobe Campaign, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Oracle Eloqua and Oracle Responsys and other destinations like Amazon S3 and more.
