# Use case description

### Check in Journey for WKND Fly Loyalty Members

As our customer's departure data approaches we want to encourage them to check in ahead of the flight. We want to give our loyalty members personalised messaging reflective of their WKND Club status.&#x20;

### What do we need to create for this use case?

1. A **segment**\
   _That contains all profiles that have a flight departing in the next 24 hours._
2. An **push** message\
   _To send to these customers_
3. A **custom action** message\
   _To send to these customers via a Webhook_
4. A **journey**\
   _To send the push and custom action messages to the segment_
