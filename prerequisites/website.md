### Showing the Real-time Customer Profile

The demo website has been extended to include a view inside Adobe Experience Platform. This allows you to look at the Real-time Customer Profile and see what data is being gathered live!&#x20;

1. Click on Adobe logo in the top left of the screen.

This will open a panel with several tabs, we'll be using the first 2 tabs only during today's session.

**Profile**\
This tab shows all the identities and attributes we know for this profile as well as segments this profile qualifies for. Additionally this tab offers some utilities like a direct link to view the profile in Adobe Experience Platform.\


**Events**\
This tab shows all events for the profile. These update in real-time and will show any action the profile takes on the website. Go ahead and try to click through the website and see how your profile events are being gathered.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If changes to the profile attributes and/or events are not reflecting instantly. Try clicking the refresh icon in the panel or refreshing the page.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to try with a fresh new profile, open the demo website in an incognito window. This will generate a new Experience Cloud ID (ECID) so you can start with an empty (unknown) customer.
